my old website

My old personal website I made because I was bored during high school.

Updates to this website will be extremely infrequent, as I am no longer in high school (and haven't been for a long time) and don't care much about this project anymore.

A more professional/good website will eventually replace this one.

Contains several games, links to proxies, and more.

There's a few hidden easter eggs and stuff to look for btw.
